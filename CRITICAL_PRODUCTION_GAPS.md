# CRITICAL: Production Data Requirements

## Current Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY

⚠️ **MAJOR ISSUE**: Your app currently uses mock data for ALL core surf conditions:
- Wave heights, wind speed, swell direction = SIMULATED
- Only sunrise/sunset is real
- Tide data framework exists but needs API key
- **Result**: Scores and forecasts are NOT accurate or live

## Required for Live Production:

### 1. **Marine Weather API** (CRITICAL - Missing)
You need a marine weather API for:
- **Wave Heights** (currently mock: `waveHeight = 0.3 + seededRandom(seed * 1.3) * 2.2`)
- **Wave Periods** (currently mock: `period = 6 + seededRandom(seed * 1.9) * 8`)
- **Wind Speed/Direction** (currently mock: simulated patterns)
- **Swell Direction/Height** (currently mock: mathematical generation)

**Recommended APIs:**
- **Stormglass.io** - Marine weather API with wave/wind/swell data
- **NOAA Marine API** - Free but US-focused
- **Magicseaweed API** - Surf-specific data
- **Weather.com Marine** - IBM Weather Company

### 2. **Admiralty Tide API** (Framework Ready)
- ✅ Netlify function created
- ❌ Missing: `ADMIRALTY_API_KEY` environment variable
- Status: Ready to activate with API key

### 3. **Data Integration Points to Update:**

#### Replace in `mockData.ts`:
```typescript
// CURRENT (MOCK):
const waveHeight = 0.3 + seededRandom(seed * 1.3) * 2.2;
const windSpeed = seededRandom(seed * 1.7) * 25;
const swellDirection = 270 + seededRandom(seed * 2.3) * 90;

// NEEDED (REAL):
const response = await fetch(`/api/marine-weather?lat=${lat}&lng=${lng}`);
const data = await response.json();
const waveHeight = data.waveHeight;
const windSpeed = data.windSpeed;
const swellDirection = data.swellDirection;
```

#### Key Files Needing Real APIs:
1. `app/utils/mockData.ts` - Replace all mock generation with API calls
2. `app/routes/home.tsx` - Update data fetching
3. `app/routes/forecast.$spotName.tsx` - Update forecast data source

## Cost Analysis:

### Stormglass.io (Recommended):
- **Free Tier**: 50 calls/day (testing only)
- **Hobby**: $8/month - 10,000 calls/month
- **Professional**: $100/month - 50,000 calls/month

### UK Admiralty API:
- **Pricing**: Check developer portal
- **Usage**: ~1-2 calls per forecast request

## Implementation Priority:

### Phase 1 (Essential):
1. **Marine Weather API** - Core requirement for accurate forecasts
2. **Update scoring system** to use real wave/wind data
3. **Admiralty API key** setup

### Phase 2 (Enhancement):
1. **Caching strategy** to reduce API costs
2. **Error handling** for API failures
3. **Hybrid approach** with smart fallbacks

## Current Scoring Accuracy:

❌ **NOT ACCURATE** because:
- Wave height scoring uses fake heights
- Wind scoring uses simulated wind
- Swell direction scoring uses mock directions
- Only tide scoring has real framework

✅ **Will be accurate** once marine APIs added because:
- Scoring algorithms are correct
- Spot preferences are accurate
- Integration points are properly coded

## Action Required:

**You cannot call this "live data" until you implement real marine weather APIs.**

The current system is a sophisticated surf forecasting simulator, not a live data system.

For true production deployment:
1. Get Stormglass.io or similar marine API subscription
2. Implement real weather data fetching
3. Add Admiralty API key
4. Test with real data vs current mock system
5. Only then deploy as "live surf forecasting"
