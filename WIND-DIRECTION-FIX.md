# Wind Direction Fix - Summary

## 🔧 **Issue Identified:**

The wind direction was showing "N/A" in the hourly chart on the **home page (finder)** but working fine on the **forecast page** because:

- **Home page**: Mock data generation in `createEnrichedSpot()` was **missing hourly wind direction data**
- **Forecast page**: Mock data generation in `generateMockForecast()` **included complete hourly data**

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### **1. Added Missing Hourly Data Generation**

Updated `app/utils/mockData.ts` → `createEnrichedSpot()` function to include:

- ✅ **24-hour wind direction array** - realistic patterns with hourly variation
- ✅ **24-hour swell direction array** - for the swell direction charts
- ✅ **Complete hourly data structure** - matches forecast page format
- ✅ **Best time calculation** - analyzes optimal surf windows

### **2. Enhanced Data Consistency**

- **Seeded random generation** - consistent results for same location
- **Realistic wind patterns** - follows diurnal wind cycles
- **Proper data structure** - matches what charts expect

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **Before Fix:**

```
Home Page Hourly Chart: Wind Direction = "N/A"
Forecast Page Hourly Chart: Wind Direction = "SW", "W", etc.
```

### **After Fix:**

```
Home Page Hourly Chart: Wind Direction = "SW", "W", "NW", etc. (24-hour data)
Forecast Page Hourly Chart: Wind Direction = "SW", "W", "NW", etc. (same format)
```

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### **Test the Fix:**

1. **Go to home page**: http://localhost:3001/
2. **Click "Find Surf Spots Near Me"** (allow location)
3. **Check hourly charts** - wind direction arrows and tooltips should now show compass directions
4. **Compare with forecast page** - data structure should be consistent

### **What You Should See:**

- 🌬️ **Wind direction arrows** in hourly chart with proper orientations
- 📊 **Tooltip wind directions** showing "SW", "W", "NW", etc. instead of "N/A"
- 🎯 **Best time analysis** working properly on home page
- 📈 **Consistent data** between home and forecast pages

## 📊 **Data Structure Now Includes:**

```javascript
spot.hourlyData = {
    waveHeight: [1.2, 1.3, 1.1, ...],      // 24 hours
    period: [8.5, 9.2, 8.8, ...],          // 24 hours
    windSpeed: [12, 15, 10, ...],           // 24 hours
    windDirection: [225, 235, 245, ...],    // 24 hours ← FIXED!
    swellDirection: [285, 290, 280, ...],   // 24 hours
    times: ["2025-08-22T00:00:00Z", ...]    // 24 hours
}
```

## 🚀 **Additional Improvements:**

- **Best time calculation** now works on home page
- **Swell direction data** available for swell charts
- **Consistent seeded randomization** for reproducible results
- **Realistic tidal patterns** following proper cycles

The wind direction "N/A" issue should now be completely resolved on both pages!
